# Interactive menus with dropdowns

In this challenge I want to create a menu with a dropdown

The dropdown will only be created using CSS and will be keyboard, touch, and mouse friendly.

That means that tabbing through the menu will work, as well as all as clicking on the top menu of the dropdown. The mouse hover will also be supported
