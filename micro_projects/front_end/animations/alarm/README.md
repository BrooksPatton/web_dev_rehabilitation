# Create a clock that tells the time

## Challenge

Create a analog clock that has second, minute, and hour arms. This will be a standard American 12-hour clock.

It needs to be decently accurate (within a minute). It also needs to be animated so that the hands are smoothly rotating around the clock face.

## Purpose

I have had trouble creating animations with transforms in the past. This exercise will help practice this skill
