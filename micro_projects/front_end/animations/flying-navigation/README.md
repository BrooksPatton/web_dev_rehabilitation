# Create a navigation animation that simulates flying through the pages

## Challenge

Create three pages where when navigating through the pages it appears that we are flying through the page. 

Going backwards isn't necessary to animate here, no need to keep a state machine for what order we've visited the pages.

## Purpose

I have had trouble creating animations with transforms in the past. This exercise will help practice this skill

Unfortunately the animations are only sometimes working dependent on browser. I feel that in the real world doing this would require a library like greensock
