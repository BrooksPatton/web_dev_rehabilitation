# web_dev_rehabilitation
Coding micro and normal projects to get myself back into coding after a break due to concussion

## How This Works

I've been forced to not work with a computer for a couple of months, and that means that I've gotten a bit stale with programming. However I am back to being able to solve logic problems and in general look at a screen for bouts of time in a row. That means that I've got to get myself into mental shape the same way that I have to get back into physical shape. Hence the rehabilitation.

In order to do this I've created several categories that I'll be creating micro projects in. Each of these projects are designed to focus on one skill or element that I am the least confident in. These micro projects will be hosted in this repository.

The rule of three is used heavily here. I feel it is important to build and burn what I learn three times to really solidify it into memory. We wouldn't do something once and then claim mastery over it. Only repeated successes can really prove that we are getting there.

I also have two bigger projects. These are more real life projects and therefore will get their own repositories. I'll link to them here though.
